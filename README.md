Analysis of political views and employment in the European Union 

Europe is shaped by a diverse group of countries with varying economic stability and political systems. We are interested in exploring trends and relationships between countries for these topics and provide further analysis.

Â As a starting point, we used K-means clustering for placing European countries into three groups based on political views ranging from faith in democracy to belief that gays should have equal rights.[1]

Countries were clustered based on the percentage of users by country that held a favorable view towards a particular political question (either strongly or completely agreeing to political question, typically a 9 or 10 on a 1-10 scale).

Overall, European countries in the first group were overall more engaged in the political system having more trust in their legislative and parliament government and finding it easier to make political decisions than countries in groups two and three.
